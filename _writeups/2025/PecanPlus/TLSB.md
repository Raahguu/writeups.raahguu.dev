## Description

You might have heard of Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography, but have you ever heard of Third Least Significant Bit (TLSB) Steganography? (Hopefully not considering I made it up for this challenge).

## Writeup

The description tells you that the steganography method to hide the flag is 'Third Least Significant Bit Encryption', which with how it also mentions LSB likely means that it is just a variation on LSB encryption.

Searching up 'Third Least Significant Bit Steganography' on google doesn't pop up with any premade tools to do this challenge with, so either you need to edit a premade tool, or make a small tool to do it for you. This writeup follows making a tool in python to read just the third least significant bit of each of the image's pixel's colour channels.

The first thing to do is to check the type of the file.

```bash
$ file TLSB

TLSB: PC bitmap, Windows 3.x format, 16 x 16 x 24, resolution 16 x 16 px/m, cbSize 822, bits offset 54
```

This displays that the image is a `BMP` file. A good website to get an idea of how BMP files are structured is [https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~elliott/ee552/studentAppNotes/2003_w/misc/bmp_file_format/bmp_file_format.htm](https://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~elliott/ee552/studentAppNotes/2003_w/misc/bmp_file_format/bmp_file_format.htm)

As the table shows (on the linked website), the actual picture data only starts on the `0x36`th  byte (the `54`th byte in decimal). This means that as any changes to the header data could cause an error, the hidden data will only begin starting on the `54`th byte. Time to write a python program that reads the third least significant bit of every byte starting from the `54`th one.

```python
with open("TLSB", "rb") as image:
    data = image.read()
    header_data = data[:54] # The data on file info, but that cant have encrypted data in it
    image_body = data[54:]
    
    hidden_data = ""

    for char in image_body:
        hidden_data += str(bin(char))[-3]

    for i in range(0, len(hidden_data), 8):
        print(hidden_data[i:i + 8], end=" ")

``` 

Running this outputs

```text

```

Converting these bytes to unicode gets 

```text
Hope you had fun :). The Flag is: `cGVjYW57VGg0dDVfbjB0X0wzNDV0X1MxZ24xZjFjNG50X2IxdF81dDNnfQ=='
```

This flag is in `base64` and when decrypted becomes `pecan{Th4t5_n0t_L345t_S1gn1f1c4nt_b1t_5t3g}`
