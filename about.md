## Hi there I'm Raahguu ðŸ‘‹

(also called Joshua Finlayson)

### About me

I am an ECU student studying cyber security. I like programming, and CTFs. I have been programming for 7 years now (as of 2025) and these days my main language used is python.

### This website

Subsequently with my enjoyment of CTFs, I am hosting this website on Github pages in order to host the writeups I make.

As I am not a frontend dev that is good with CSS or HTML, to make this website I forked off of the Jekyll 'Hacker' theme [github.com/pages-themes/hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker). This site runs entirely on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using markdown files to create the content for everypage, as this is hosted with Github pages on my free account, the source code for this website is available at [Github repo for writeups.raahguu.dev](https://github.com/Raahguu/writeups.raahguu.dev)
