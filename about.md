## Hi there I'm Raahguu ðŸ‘‹

(also called Joshua Finlayson)

### About me

I am an ECU student studying cyber security. I like programming, and CTFs. I have been programming for 7 years now (as of 2025) and these days my main language used is python.

### This website

Subsequently with my enjoyment of CTFs, I am hosting this website on Github pages in order to host the writeups I make.

As I am not a frontend dev that is good with CSS or HTML, to make this website I forked off of the Jekyll 'Hacker' theme [github.com/pages-themes/hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker)
